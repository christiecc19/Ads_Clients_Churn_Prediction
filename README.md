# Clients Churn Prediction
This project built a model to predict whether clients will churn or not

Pre-processed dataset by data cleaning, categorical features transformation.

Trained supervised machine learning models by applying different Machine Learning Algorithms which include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors. 

Optimized the hyperparameters by using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy. 

Evaluated model performance from each  corresponding algorithm, analyzed feature importance to identify key factors which influenced the churn  probability.
